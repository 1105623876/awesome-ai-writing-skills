# Writing Checklists

Use this file to prevent omissions during planning, drafting, revision, score lifting, and final readiness checks. For small paragraph edits, run only the relevant subset and state what was intentionally skipped.

## Intake Checklist

- Target venue, track, and paper type are known, or the user-custom format is explicitly assumed.
- Deadline pressure and desired output granularity are known: plan, rewrite, line edit, review, or final check.
- Available materials are listed: manuscript, appendix, figures, tables, reviews, code, experiments, references, style exemplars.
- Missing materials that affect confidence are named.
- Claims that cannot be verified from provided materials are not treated as facts.

## Venue And Style Checklist

- Venue family is mapped with `ccf-a-venue-map.md` when a CCF-A target is named.
- Venue expectations are selected from `venue-adapters.md`.
- If no venue is named, `custom-format/default-user-format.md` is used and labeled.
- Exemplar cards are used only for writing moves, not wording or technical content.
- Venue-specific evidence package is visible: baselines, ablations, proof, user study, systems evaluation, security threat model, visual evidence, or theory proof as appropriate.

## Global Story Checklist

Every major output must preserve this chain:

```text
task -> gap -> root challenge -> insight -> method mechanism -> evidence -> limitation
```

Check:

- The problem is concrete enough for the venue's audience.
- The gap explains why prior work is insufficient.
- The root challenge is technical, scientific, empirical, or human-centered, not just "existing methods fail."
- The insight explains why the proposed method should work.
- The method mechanism connects to the insight.
- The evidence package tests the central claim.
- The limitation bounds the claim honestly.

## Section Revision Checklist

- The section role is named before revision.
- Each paragraph has one main message.
- The first sentence of each paragraph signals that message.
- Terminology is stable across sections.
- Transitions show cause, contrast, consequence, refinement, or example.
- Figures and tables are introduced before interpretation.
- Captions state what the reviewer should learn.
- The section ends with the intended next-step logic when appropriate.

## Claim-Evidence Checklist

For every major Abstract, Introduction, and Conclusion claim:

```text
Claim:
Location:
Evidence:
Evidence type:
Support level: strong / adequate / weak / absent
Required action:
```

Rules:

- Supported claims may be sharpened.
- Weakly supported claims must be narrowed or tied to stronger evidence.
- Unsupported claims must be removed, weakened, or marked as requiring new evidence.
- Evidence hidden only in the appendix must be signposted in the main text.

## Reviewer-Risk Checklist

Scan for:

- unclear contribution,
- weak novelty positioning,
- significance unclear for the venue,
- unsupported central claim,
- weak baseline,
- missing ablation, proof, user study, or system evaluation,
- unfair protocol or metric,
- reproducibility gap,
- figure/table readability issue,
- overclaim,
- generic limitation,
- ethics or responsible-research issue,
- venue mismatch.

## Score-Lifting Checklist

Use with `score-lifting-loop.md` and, only when explicitly requested or confirmed after the optional-module gate, `ccf-conference-paper-reviewer`.

- Current likely score or stance is stated.
- Target score or readiness threshold is stated.
- Top score blockers are ranked by severity.
- Each blocker has a fix class: writing-fixable, analysis-fixable, citation/positioning, figure/table, reproducibility, requires-new-result, accepted-limitation, or venue-mismatch.
- Writing-only fixes are separated from fixes requiring new experiments, proofs, studies, or baselines.
- Expected score impact is attached only to concrete changes.
- After revision, the same reviewer concern is re-tested.

## Final Readiness Checklist

Do not call a paper or section ready until:

- The target venue/custom format is clear.
- The global story is internally consistent.
- Central claims have visible support.
- Closest prior work and strongest baselines are handled.
- Venue-specific evidence is visible in the main paper.
- Limitations are honest and bounded.
- Reproducibility and ethics details are present where relevant.
- No high-severity issue remains unlabeled.
- The final answer states passed checks, skipped checks, and unresolved risks.
